> We've GOT to work on a thorough list of the DOJ lawyers who have done evil and dishonest things for this administration.

This was in response to a court order noting "the Court is left with little confidence that the defense can be trusted to tell the truth about anything."

Whether it's sending folks to El Salvadoran penal farms, cutting off life-saving aid to impoverished
foreign children, deporting university students for their views, the DOJ has been busy!

This repo tries to provide a centralized way to track that activity.

# How to use this

On Bluesky, reply to interesting tweets and tag `@trumpslawyers.bsky.social`.

Your tweet should also reference a DOJ case by including:

- a CourtListener Docket URL, e.g. https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/69741724/jgg-v-trump/
- a CourtListener RECAP URL, e.g. https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.dcd.278436/gov.uscourts.dcd.278436.25.0.pdf

Those tweets will get discovered by a bot and included in the website.

If you change your mind, you can delete your reply. The parent tweet will no longer show up in the website.
