> We've GOT to work on a thorough list of the DOJ lawyers who have done evil and dishonest things for this administration.

This was in response to a court order noting "the Court is left with little confidence that the defense can be trusted to tell the truth about anything."

Whether it's sending folks to El Salvadoran penal farms, cutting off life-saving aid to impoverished
foreign children, deporting university students for their views, the DOJ has been busy!

This repo tries to provide a centralized way to track that activity.

# How to use this

On Bluesky, tweet `@trumpslawyers.bsky.social`. Your tweet should reference a DOJ case by including a CourtListener URL to a docket or docket entry.

Your tweet must also include one of:

- a link to media commentary (e.g. a website URL, or quote-tweeting a Bluesky tweet)
- an excerpt from the linked docket entry

Those tweets will get discovered by a bot and included in the website.

> [!NOTE]
> 
> Bluesky tweets have a strict character limit. If you want to excerpt more
> text than fits in a tweet, please add a reaction gif with ALT text.
>
> The ALT text will be used as the excerpt.
>
> Yes, this is a huge hack.

## Change your mind?

If you delete your tweet, the entry in the website will be suppressed.

# How it works
